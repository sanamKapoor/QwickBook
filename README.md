# QwickBook
QwickBook is my first real world project that i build with many technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap on front-end.
And for back-end i used NodeJs, ExpressJs and MongoDB with mongoose and other libraries like bcryptjs for password encryption etc.
Mainly i used MVC approach. QwickBook is a platform on which anyone can sell his old or new books and also can buy at the same time.
QwickBook provide a platform for book lovers and establish direct connection between seller and consumer.
